# Spicify

Playlist generator using the Spotify Api!

### Functionalities

The main functionality of this web application is to ge a tool to generate new playlists for music enthusiasts or casual listeners. Spicify has categories of playlists to choose from.The categories include: Workout, General Driving, International, Year Range (1930s, 1940s, 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s), Surprise Me, Study and Related Artists. A user can click on any of the category buttons and playlist will be generated and saved into their Spotify library.

There is also the functionaltiy of the current user's Spotify username and playlists displayed on the left hand side navigation bar.
Users can also rate Spicify's generated playlist on a scale of one to five stars.
After a user creates any of Spicify's playlist the new playlist will display in the application window.

### Purpose
Our goal in creating this app was to generate playlists with new songs you do not hear on the radio everyday. In our search queries looking within the Spotify Api for music, we take the popularity attribute of tracks into consideration for our Workout, Study, General Driving and Surprise Me Playlsits. We want to find songs that are less popular (less than 70). Spotify rates popularity on a 0 to 100 scale. Adding this attribute into our other playlists does not make as much sense. For example, when creating a year range playlist you do not want to hear the least popularity songs from that year. Our internaional playlist, consists of songs from markets like Arab and Indian, outside the United States gathering international music to create a playlist for a user who may other not have picked these songs to listen to. For our related artists playlist, the user chooses an artist they may be familiar with and enjoy their music and then generates a playlsits of rongs by related artists to the artist they chose. This is again, expanding the users music they typically listen to.

We hope all of our users explore and find music outside their comfort zone!
