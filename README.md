There is also the functionaltiy of the current user's Spotify username and playlists displayed on the left hand side navigation bar.
Users can also rate Spicify's generated playlist on a scale of one to five stars.

### Purpose
Our goal in creating this app was to generate playlists with new songs you do not hear on the radio everyday. In our search queries looking within the Spotify Api for music, we take the popularity attribute of tracks into consideration. We want to find songs that are less popular (less than 70). Spotify rates popularity on a 0 to 100 scale.

### Contributors

We had a team of four students contributing on this project. Gianna Marchetti, Travis Preston, Shubham Tiwari and Alex Gonzales.
